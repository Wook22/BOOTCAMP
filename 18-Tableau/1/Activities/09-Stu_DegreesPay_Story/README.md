# Degrees That Pay

You will now build on everything you have learned today to create a story in Tableau that visualizes what degrees/universities/regions “pay off” the most over time.

## Instructions

* Create a story using the datasets provided, and formulate graphs that might be used to explore the following hypotheses:

1. Do Engineering majors earn more than other majors?

2. Does having a graduate degree lead to higher earnings?

3. Are higher salaries linked to higher unemployment rates?

    **Note:** You do not have to join any of the data for this activity. The worksheets that you will be creating do not require you to join the datasets in Tableau.

## Bonus

Verify one of the three assumptions:

* Graduates from Ivy League schools typically commence their careers with higher salaries.

* Enrolling in schools located in the West or Northeast tends to lead to higher starting salaries.

* Higher initial salaries are often associated with higher midcareer salaries.
